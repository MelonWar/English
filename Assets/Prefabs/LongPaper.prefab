  - "Now that you have understood the bases of neural networks, you might wonder
    how developers manage to arrange the weight and bias of each neuron in order
    to achieve the desired goal, considering that the biggest networks can contain
    up to hundreds of neurons. The answer is that they don\u2019t do it themselves.
    In fact, it would be nearly impossible to figure out the required combination
    of weights and biases in a big network due to how abstract and complex it is."
  - 'In practice, deep neural networks learn by themselves. Developers train neural
    networks on large data sets. The idea is quite simple : you feed the algorithm
    with an input and let it process it to give an output. For the training data,
    there is an expected output associated with every input. The output of the algorithm
    is then compared to the expected output in a loss function, which essentially
    calculates how much the neural network prediction is wrong compared to the expected
    answer. Then, based on the result of the loss function, there is a combination
    of complex techniques, called backpropagation and gradient descent, which slightly
    modify the weights and biases of the network in order to improve the accuracy
    of the network in future iterations.'
  - The training process of a neural network can be very long and requires enormous
    quantities of data. That is why we often hear that data is the new oil. Another
    thing to take into consideration is that the data set on which the AI has been
    trained on will greatly influence its outputs. For example, a facial recognition
    algorithm which was trained mostly on white Americans had difficulties detecting
    faces which were not similar to those in the training data set, like Black people.
    Often, what takes the biggest amount of time when developing a new AI system
    is gathering enough data, labeling it correctly and making sure that this data
    covers all the possible situations the AI might need to handle.
  - "Another thing you might have realized when playing with the networks in the
    previous rooms is how complex these algorithms can become. With only 3 layers
    and a low number of neurons, it can be really hard to understand how each input
    affects the next layer and, in turn, the output. With more layers and more neurons,
    it is practically impossible to understand the network in its entirety. This
    is why neural networks are often called \u201Cblack boxes\u201D. The developers
    know what comes into the network but have no idea how it is processed and how
    the network arrives at a certain output. For example, if you feed an image recognition
    algorithm an image of a cat and it says it is a bus, it is hard to know what
    went wrong."
  - "In some cases, it is not really important to know how the algorithm arrived
    at a certain output, but in other cases, it may be necessary to use other algorithms
    which are way easier to interpret like decision trees. Here is a great example
    of such a situation : \u201Ca lot of banks don\u2019t use neural networks to
    predict whether a person is creditworthy \u2014 they need to explain to their
    customers why they didn\u2019t get the loan, otherwise the person may feel unfairly
    treated.\u201D[4] In the long run, we might not always want to take advice from
    artificial neural networks, because we have no idea how they came up with those
    advices and it is important to know the reflexion process before taking an important
    decision."
  - At the same time, it is understandable that artificial neural networks are hard
    to pierce through, because they try to mimic biological neural networks which
    we still have minimal knowledge about. For example, when you come up with an
    idea, it is impossible to pinpoint what neurons in your brain fired at which
    moments to create this idea. For humans, although, people are usually able to
    explain their reasoning to others when asked to do so. This is something scientists
    are still working on for AI systems
